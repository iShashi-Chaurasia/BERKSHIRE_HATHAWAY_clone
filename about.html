      <p>Dear Reader,</p>
      <p>
        You probably know that I don't make stock recommendations. However, I have two thoughts regarding your personal expenditures that can save you real money. I'm suggesting that you call on the services of two subsidiaries of Berkshire: <strong>GEICO</strong> and <strong>Borsheim's</strong>.

      <p class="section-title">1. Save Money on Auto Insurance with GEICO</p>
      <p>
        I estimate that about 40% of all auto drivers in the country can save money by insuring with GEICO. The figure is not 100% because insurers differ in their underwriting judgments, with some favoring drivers who live in certain geographical areas and work in certain occupations more than GEICO does. I believe, however, that GEICO more frequently offers the low price than does any other national carrier selling insurance to all comers.
      </p>
      <p>
        You can quickly find out whether you can save money by visiting
        <a href="https://www.geico.com" target="_blank">www.geico.com</a> or calling <span class="contact">800-555-2756</span>.

      <p class="section-title">2. Save on Fine Jewelry at Borsheim's</p>
      <p>
        Fine jewelry, watches, and giftware will almost certainly cost you less at Borsheim's. I've looked at the figures for all publicly-owned jewelry companies, and the contrast with Borsheim's is startling. Our one-store operation, with its huge volume, enables us to operate with costs that are fully 15-20 percentage points below those incurred by our competitors. We pass the benefits of this low-cost structure along to our customers.
      </p>
      <p>
        Every year Borsheim's sends out thousands of selections to customers who want a long-distance opportunity to inspect what it offers and decide which, if any, item they'd like to purchase. We do a huge amount of business in this low-key way, which allows the shopper to conveniently see the exceptional values that we offer.
      </p>
      <p>
        Call <span class="contact">Sean Moore</span> or <span class="contact">Karen Goracke</span> at Borsheim's (<span class="contact">800-642-4438</span>) and save substantial money on your next purchase of jewelry.
